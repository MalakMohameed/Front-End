##  Angular User Dashboard

This Angular User Dashboard project demonstrates proficiency in Angular (7+) by creating an interactive user dashboard with advanced features such as state management frameworks, directives, and observables. The dashboard allows users to view a paginated list of users fetched from a remote API, search for users by ID, and navigate to detailed user information pages. The project emphasizes proper styling, animations, caching techniques, and user experience enhancements.

#Features:

-Fetch user data from remote API endpoints for pagination and individual user details.
-Enable navigation between pages and display detailed user information.
--Implement instant search functionality to search for users by ID.
--Utilize caching mechanisms to optimize performance and reduce redundant HTTP requests.
--Enhance user experience with loading indicators and smooth animations.
--Employ Angular Material UI library for consistent and responsive design.


#Additional Considerations:

--Utilize state management frameworks like NgRx or Redux for efficient state handling.
--Implement custom directives for improved UI interactions.
--Utilize observables from RxJS to manage asynchronous operations.
--Ensure a well-documented and structured project codebase.


This Angular User Dashboard project serves as a showcase of advanced Angular features, best practices, and creating dynamic user interfaces with a focus on clarity, performance, and usability.
